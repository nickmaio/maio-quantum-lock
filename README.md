# Maio Quantum Box

Maio Quantum Box is a single-page browser quantum-proof encryption tool. It provides a focused interface for encrypting and decrypting text locally with the Web Crypto API.

It doesn't send data to the Internet: there is no backend, database, authentication layer, or server-side storage.

## Features

- Interactive encryption/decryption lab using AES-GCM in the browser
- Versioned encrypted payload format with legacy payload compatibility

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Use a recent Node.js version. Node 18 or newer is recommended.

### Install

```bash
npm install
```

### Run Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

The Vite dev server is configured to run on port `8080`:

```text
http://localhost:8080
```

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

### Preview Production Build

```bash
npm run preview
```

### Test

```bash
npm run test
```

### Lint

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Encryption Lab

The Lab section lets a user encrypt and decrypt text entirely in the browser. The helper in `src/lib/crypto.js`:

- Derives a 256-bit AES-GCM key from a password with PBKDF2-SHA256
- Uses 600,000 PBKDF2 iterations
- Generates a random 16-byte salt
- Generates a random 12-byte initialization vector
- Returns a versioned `mqb1` payload containing Base64URL-encoded salt, IV, and ciphertext
- Validates encrypted payload structure before attempting decryption
- Supports the earlier legacy `salt + iv + ciphertext` Base64 payload format for backward compatibility

Nothing is sent to a server by this project. The plaintext, password, and ciphertext live only in the browser runtime unless the user copies or stores them elsewhere.

Security note: Maio Quantum Box is designed for cases where the shared password is exchanged offline or through a separate trusted channel, so it does not include direct online key exchange. AES-256-GCM provides a strong symmetric-encryption margin, including against known quantum search attacks when paired with a strong password. This project is still not a formally audited security product, and password strength remains critical.

## Configuration Notes

- Path alias `@` maps to `src/` through `vite.config.ts`.
- Vite serves on host `::` and port `8080`.
- Google Fonts are imported from `src/index.css`, so the page may request external font files at runtime.

## Deployment

This is a static Vite app. Any host that can serve static files can deploy it.

Typical deployment flow:

```bash
npm run build
```

Then deploy the generated `dist/` directory to a static hosting provider such as Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, or an object-storage/CDN setup.

If deploying under a subpath, update the Vite `base` option as needed.
